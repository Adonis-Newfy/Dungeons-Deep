# Dungeons-Deep
 
Dungeons Deep V0.0.1 as it stands so far. You should be able to control the character with the arrow keys,
and the character should collide with walls and move on a tile grid in all cardinal and intercardinal directions (external controller support not yet implemented).
Note that there is no way to close the game "properly" at present, so you will need to force-quit the program to close it.

For Windows: Simply open the "Windows" folder and run the executable file "Dungeons Deep.exe".

For Linux: Simply open the "Linux" folder and run the LinuxVer.x86_64 file.

For MacOS: Mac is trouble.
		
	   With terminal you need to navigate to the download folder (or wherever you put your app):

		cd <PATH_TO_YOUR_APP>/<APP_NAME>.app/Contents/MacOS/

	   and add the following:

		sudo chmod -R 777 [applicationName]

	   When prompted, enter your computer login password.

	   After you enter your (computer) password into the terminal and it accepts it (note that your password will not be
	   displayed in the terminal), you may attempt to run the app . It might deny you because it is from an "unusual source".
		
	   Open System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Allow Access to Untrusted Program (prompt will be within the window)
	   When you click "Open Anyways", you'll be prompted again. Clicking "Allow" will open the application. Any subsequent attempts to open
	   this version of the app can simply be achieved by running the application.

	   Once the above is completed: you can open the game by running the "Dungeons Deep.app" file within the Mac->Dungeons Deep folder.
